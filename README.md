- ## About

This is a machine learning project. The name of the project is Unsupervised Learning Analysis.

- ## Project description:
The project uses the dataset UsArrests.csv to generate an in-depth PCA report of the data.
Also, at the end we created a hierarchical clustering and K-means methods.
The process is guided and there is an interpretation of all the analysis made.

- ## Installation

The file should be used in Jupyter Notebook. Once it is opened in Jupyter, we need to install all the
required modules. All the necessary modules are in the first line of code and they can be installed using
your terminal. Finally, we need to download the UsArrests.csv and "Unsupervised Learning Analysis.ipynb" files,
which are in this repository, and store them in the same folder so that we can run the project in Jupyter.

+ ### How it works

1 We are at the top.

5 Now it goes to the bottom automatically.

6 We wait for it to load all the code. Then go to the top and you can start reading the project.
