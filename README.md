- This is a machine learning project. The name of the project is Unsupervised Learning Analysis.

-Project description:
The project uses the dataset UsArrests.csv to generate an in-depth PCA report of the data.
Also, at the end we created a hierarchical clustering and K-means methods.
The process is guided and there is an interpretation of all the analysis made.

3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. Kâ€“means

- Installation:

The file should be used in Jupyter Notebook. Once it is opened in Jupyter, we need to install all the
required modules. All the necessary modules are in the first line of code and they can be installed using
your terminal. Finally, we need to download the UsArrests.csv file, which is in this repository and keep
the "Unsupervised Learning Analysis.ipynb" and "UsArrests.csv" files in the same folder so that we can run the
project in Jupyter.
